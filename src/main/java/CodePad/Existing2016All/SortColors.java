/**
 * Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them so that objects of the same
 * color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.
 *
 * Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue
 * respectively.
 *
 * Note: You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.
 *
 * Follow up: A rather straight forward solution is a two-pass algorithm using counting sort. First,
 * iterate the array counting number of 0's, 1's, and 2's, then overwrite array with total number of
 * 0's, then 1's and followed by 2's.
 *
 * Could you come up with an one-pass algorithm using only constant space?
